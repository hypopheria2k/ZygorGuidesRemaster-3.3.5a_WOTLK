## Version

- Version: ![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/t/ErebusAres/ZygorGuidesRemaster-3.3.5a_WOTLK?label=Version%203.0.&color=1f6feb)
- Intended client: **WotLK 3.3.5a / 12340**

## Who This Is For

This addon is intended for:

- World of Warcraft **WotLK 3.3.5a (build 12340)** clients
- Private server environments (for example TrinityCore-based servers)
- Players who want the classic Zygor guide experience with a cleaner UI

This project is primarily focused on **WotLK 3.3.5a**. Other clients may work, but support and testing are centered on 3.3.5a.

## What You Get

- Step-by-step leveling and quest progression guidance.
- Arrow and waypoint navigation while you play.
- Structured objective flow (accept, complete, and turn-in).
- A cleaner, more readable viewer UI designed for long play sessions.
- Includes talent guidance via the bundled `ZygorTalentAdvisor` module inside `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`.

## What Stayed the Same

Core 3.3.5a-era behavior is preserved:

- Guide parser and step engine.
- Map and waypoint workflow.
- Legacy guide execution patterns.
- Base `ZygorTalentAdvisor` behavior and structure.

## What's New in the Remaster

- Cleaner, retail-inspired UI shell for both guide browsing and options.
- New standalone Guide Manager (Home / Featured / Current / Recent) with category sidebar, search, favorites, and folder-style tree behavior.
- New in-app Options experience with categorized navigation, searchable pages, and improved layout consistency.
- Remastered waypoint arrow and objective text styling updates, including clearer action/title/distance presentation and distance color gradients.
- Accessibility improvements including colorblind presets and simplified noun-color handling for better readability.
- Ongoing compatibility focus for 3.3.5a environments and expanded guide coverage where applicable.

## Included Components

1. `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` - Remastered viewer and guide runtime.
2. `ZygorTalentAdvisor` - bundled inside `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` and loaded as part of the addon package.

## Key Controls

- Minimap icon:
  - Left-click toggles the guide viewer.
  - Right-click opens the Guide Manager.
  - Shift + Right-click opens options.
- Viewer toolbar:
  - Guides left-click opens the legacy quick guide dropdown.
  - Guides right-click opens the Guide Manager.
  - Settings left-click opens quick settings.
  - Settings right-click opens Guide Manager options.

## Quick Install

### Installation Overview

1. Download the ZIP.
2. Extract to `Interface\AddOns\`.
3. Launch the game.
4. Enable the addon.

### Detailed Steps

1. Close World of Warcraft.
2. Open `%WoWFolder%\Interface\AddOns\`.
3. Remove older folders if present:
   - `ZygorGuidesViewer`
   - `ZygorTalentAdvisor`
   - This avoids mixed files from older releases.
4. Copy this folder into `AddOns`:
   - `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`
5. Confirm the top-level folder exists:
   - `Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM\ZygorGuidesViewerRM.toc`
6. Launch the game and enable the addon.

## Common Issues

**Addon not showing in-game**

- Make sure the folder structure is:
  - `Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM\ZygorGuidesViewerRM.toc`
- Do not nest folders (no double folder level).

**Out of date warning**

- Enable **Load out of date AddOns** on the character select screen.

**Guide not progressing**

- Some imported guides may not fully match 3.3.5a data.
- See the Known Issues section below.

## Update Notes

1. Install or update the `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` folder as a single addon package.
2. `/reload` is usually enough for Lua-only changes.
3. A full relaunch is safer when files, XML includes, assets, or bundled modules change.

## Guide Profiles

- Current default guide content is the remastered, TrinityCore-oriented profile for WotLK 3.3.5a private servers.
- An optional Alliance fallback profile exists at `Guides\Leveling_Original\ZygorGuidesAlliance.lua`.
- That fallback is original, unmodified classic Zygor content and should only be used if the remastered default route is problematic for a specific session.

## Localization

Localization key coverage is complete across shipped locales (`Main` + `NPCs`) with placeholder and format-consistency checks.

Current focus is community QA review:

- natural phrasing in live gameplay context,
- terminology consistency,
- official localized NPC proper names,
- encoding and readability verification.

Localization was largely AI-assisted and should be treated as needing community review until native-speaker QA confirms quality.

### Community Credits

- [`mikki33`](https://github.com/mikki33) for providing Russian localization changes and review updates.

## Support Wanted (Localization QA)

If you can validate translations in-game, your help is very welcome.

Please report:

- mistranslations,
- awkward phrasing,
- broken placeholders (`%s`, `%d`, `|n`, color codes),
- incorrect NPC names,
- encoding artifacts.

## Safety and Trust

This addon is fully open source and can be inspected before use.

## Changelog

### Revision 182 - 3.0.182

- Added a targeted Gear Advisor guard for WotLK tooltips that mark an equipment subtype red on the right side of the item type row.
- Items flagged this way are rejected before scoring with diagnostic code `tooltip_subtype`.
- Updated `/zgvgearbug` output to include `tipUnusable=true/false` in the cached item line.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.182.

### Revision 181 - 3.0.181

- Added the diagnostic-only `/zgvgearbug` slash command for Gear Advisor/Gear Finder item reports.
- The command prints DB, live item info, cached item state, advisor validity, score, API probes, equipped slot baselines, and tooltip scanner color lines for a supplied item ID/link.
- No recommendation behavior was changed in this release.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.181.

### Revision 180 - 3.0.180

- Rolled Gear Advisor scoring and bundled item DB metadata back to the 3.0.172 baseline after reports that the 3.0.173-3.0.179 advisor changes broke tooltip recommendations and Gear Finder behavior.
- Removed the experimental localized armor/weapon guards, runtime usability guard, tooltip-color guard, pending DB-only item guard, and item-template class/subclass DB enrichment from the shipped code path.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.180.

### Revision 179 - 3.0.179

- Added numeric WotLK item-template class/subclass metadata to armor and weapon records in the bundled item DB.
- Gear Advisor now uses DB-backed armor and weapon family data as a reliable fallback when live tooltip data is unavailable.
- This keeps the 3.0.178 safety behavior while preventing localized tooltip/cache gaps from hiding basic usability data such as cloth, leather, mail, plate, shields, guns, bows, and wands.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.179.
### Revision 178 - 3.0.178

- Changed Gear Advisor item resolution so DB-only fallback gear records remain pending until Blizzard/tooltip item details are available.
- Pending gear records are no longer eligible for advisor validity or score comparisons, preventing armor-only fallback data from recommending unusable leather/mail items to cloth-only classes.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.178.

### Revision 177 - 3.0.177

- Added a Gear Advisor tooltip-color guard so items with Blizzard-red unusable armor or weapon type lines are rejected before scoring.
- Caches tooltip unusability during item scans and applies it in both immediate item validity paths.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.177.

### Revision 176 - 3.0.176

- Added a Gear Advisor runtime usability guard so items Blizzard reports as unusable for the current character are rejected before scoring.
- Applies the guard before armor/DPS fallback comparisons to prevent unusable armor or weapon recommendations when localized subtype metadata is incomplete.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.176.

### Revision 175 - 3.0.175

- Fixed Gear Advisor armor-family detection so numeric item class/subclass data is preferred before localized text heuristics.
- Routed localized subtype matching through the canonical localized lookup instead of the older English-only alias table.
- This prevents leather and mail armor from being recommended to cloth-only classes through armor-only fallback scoring.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.175.

### Revision 174 - 3.0.174

- Fixed Gear Advisor weapon-family validation on localized clients so unusable weapon subtypes are rejected before DPS fallback scoring can recommend them.
- Added localized weapon subtype resolution for standard WotLK weapon families, including guns, bows, crossbows, thrown weapons, wands, and melee weapon types.
- Added defensive spear handling as a polearm-family alias.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.174.

### Revision 173 - 3.0.173

- Fixed Gear Advisor armor-family validation on localized clients so unusable armor subtypes are rejected before armor-only fallback scoring can recommend them.
- Added localized armor subtype resolution for cloth, leather, mail, plate, and shield, with ruRU fallback aliases for tooltip wording differences.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.173.

### Revision 172 - 3.0.172

- Fixed Gear Finder empty result rows so internal `reject:` diagnostics no longer appear under `No upgrade found`.
- Prevented Gear Finder from recommending an exact item already equipped in a ring or trinket paired slot.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.172.

### Revision 171 - 3.0.171

- Reduced built-in waypoint arrow garbage generation by separating arrow direction updates from distance/title/ETA text refreshes.
- Added guards so unchanged arrow labels are not repeatedly rewritten, reused fallback color tables in the arrow update path, and fixed ETA averaging when no speed samples are available.
- Added arrow optimization controls: 10 FPS arrow refresh, separate Arrow Text Refresh cadence, and an Animated Arrow Pulse toggle for lower per-frame visual work.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.171.

### Revision 170 - 3.0.170

- Fixed `|only if not Orc Warlock`-style race/class guide conditions so they route through the requirement matcher instead of producing invalid Lua. Thanks to Hypopheria for the report and test guide notes.
- Fixed minimap waypoint update crashes when marker frames lose their waypoint during an update, and guarded Astrolabe minimap diameter lookup against custom indoor/zoom states.
- Added a Talent Advisor enable toggle, hid the talent-tab advisor button when disabled, restored the button when enabled, and expanded the suggestion scroll area for larger unspent-talent batches.
- Fixed the Gear Advisor character-screen Z button so disabling Gear Advisor hides the PaperDoll button and prevents the finder from opening.
- Applied apesquatch's guide/runtime fixes from PRs #43-#48: class-defining `|noobsolete` quest tags, quest-chain corrections, Razor Hill envelope/key tag updates, guide metadata hoisting, and `Goal:IsFitting()` returning `self.wrong` state correctly.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.170.

### Revision 169 - 3.0.169

- Added an off-by-default Gear Finder `Prefer tier progression` mode that keeps the default best-path ranking unchanged unless enabled.
- Tier progression now prefers base WotLK dungeon/heroic progression, treats Trial of the Champion, Forge of Souls, Pit of Saron, and Halls of Reflection as catch-up 5-mans, and falls forward per slot only when no upgrade exists in the current progression band.
- Excluded raid-crafted items from tier-progression recommendations while preserving them for the default best-path mode.
- Added race-mask validation from `ZygorItemDB.lua` so Gear Finder rejects race-locked items the current character cannot equip.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.169.

### Revision 168 - 3.0.168

- Added 76 additional missing item database records from `check_result (1).md` after verifying each item ID/name against WotLKDB.
- Re-sorted `ZygorItemDB.lua` after the import by item level descending and item ID ascending, keeping the item database mechanically ordered.
- Updated `ZygorItemDB.lua` metadata to `2026-05-13 12:15:18 -05:00` and `25183 Items`.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.168.

### Revision 167 - 3.0.167

- Added 170 missing low-level item records from the latest item database check result after verifying each item ID/name against WotLKDB.
- Re-sorted `ZygorItemDB.lua` by item level descending and item ID ascending within each item level for easier review and future maintenance.
- Updated `ZygorItemDB.lua` metadata to `2026-05-13 10:21:00 -05:00` and `25107 Items`.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.167.

### Revision 166 - 3.0.166

- Added a ChromieCraft compatibility guard for `QuestPOI_HideButtons` so missing Blizzard POI button globals no longer crash Astrolabe-driven map marker placement.
- Added LibRover compatibility shims for partial `C_Map` tables that omit `GetBestMapForUnit` or `GetPlayerMapPosition` on 3.3.5a clients.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.166.

### Revision 165 - 3.0.165

- Fixed a combat-lockdown blocked action error where the floating action button bar could call protected `Hide()` paths while entering combat.
- Added missing item database records for `23478` Recruit's Pants, `23479` Recruit's Robe, `1374` Frayed Shoes, and `2650` Flimsy Chain Boots.
- Updated `ZygorItemDB.lua` metadata to `2026-05-13 09:12:38 -05:00` and `24937 Items`.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.165.

## Notes

- Intended target client is **WotLK 3.3.5a (12340)**.
- It may work on other versions, but compatibility is not guaranteed.
- `ZygorTalentAdvisor` is bundled and loaded from within `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`.

## Known Issues

- Arrow scale/position drift:
  - On some setups, changing Waypoint Arrow Scale can shift the arrow position unexpectedly.
  - Resetting arrow position may not fully normalize the anchor in all UI/minimap addon combinations.
  - Status: deferred for now.

- Some imported guides may be incomplete or not fully aligned to 3.3.5a data.
- If a guide behaves incorrectly, disable it in `ZygorGuidesViewerRM/Guides/Autoload.xml` and report it.
