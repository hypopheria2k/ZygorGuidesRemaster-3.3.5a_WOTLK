## Version

- Version: ![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/t/ErebusAres/ZygorGuidesRemaster-3.3.5a_WOTLK?label=Version%203.0.&color=1f6feb)
- Intended client: **WotLK 3.3.5a / 12340**

## Who This Is For

This addon is intended for:

- World of Warcraft **WotLK 3.3.5a (build 12340)** clients
- Private server environments (for example TrinityCore-based servers)
- Players who want the classic Zygor guide experience with a cleaner UI

This project is primarily focused on **WotLK 3.3.5a**. Other clients may work, but support and testing are centered on 3.3.5a.

## What You Get

- Step-by-step leveling and quest progression guidance.
- Arrow and waypoint navigation while you play.
- Structured objective flow (accept, complete, and turn-in).
- A cleaner, more readable viewer UI designed for long play sessions.
- Includes talent guidance via the bundled `ZygorTalentAdvisor` module inside `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`.

## What Stayed the Same

Core 3.3.5a-era behavior is preserved:

- Guide parser and step engine.
- Map and waypoint workflow.
- Legacy guide execution patterns.
- Base `ZygorTalentAdvisor` behavior and structure.

## What's New in the Remaster

- Cleaner, retail-inspired UI shell for both guide browsing and options.
- New standalone Guide Manager (Home / Featured / Current / Recent) with category sidebar, search, favorites, and folder-style tree behavior.
- New in-app Options experience with categorized navigation, searchable pages, and improved layout consistency.
- Remastered waypoint arrow and objective text styling updates, including clearer action/title/distance presentation and distance color gradients.
- Accessibility improvements including colorblind presets and simplified noun-color handling for better readability.
- Ongoing compatibility focus for 3.3.5a environments and expanded guide coverage where applicable.

## Included Components

1. `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` - Remastered viewer and guide runtime.
2. `ZygorTalentAdvisor` - bundled inside `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` and loaded as part of the addon package.

## Key Controls

- Minimap icon:
  - Left-click toggles the guide viewer.
  - Right-click opens the Guide Manager.
  - Shift + Right-click opens options.
- Viewer toolbar:
  - Guides left-click opens the legacy quick guide dropdown.
  - Guides right-click opens the Guide Manager.
  - Settings left-click opens quick settings.
  - Settings right-click opens Guide Manager options.

## Quick Install

### Installation Overview

1. Download the ZIP.
2. Extract to `Interface\AddOns\`.
3. Launch the game.
4. Enable the addon.

### Detailed Steps

1. Close World of Warcraft.
2. Open `%WoWFolder%\Interface\AddOns\`.
3. Remove older folders if present:
   - `ZygorGuidesViewer`
   - `ZygorTalentAdvisor`
   - This avoids mixed files from older releases.
4. Copy this folder into `AddOns`:
   - `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`
5. Confirm the top-level folder exists:
   - `Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM\ZygorGuidesViewerRM.toc`
6. Launch the game and enable the addon.

## Common Issues

**Addon not showing in-game**

- Make sure the folder structure is:
  - `Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM\ZygorGuidesViewerRM.toc`
- Do not nest folders (no double folder level).

**Out of date warning**

- Enable **Load out of date AddOns** on the character select screen.

**Guide not progressing**

- Some imported guides may not fully match 3.3.5a data.
- See the Known Issues section below.

## Update Notes

1. Install or update the `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` folder as a single addon package.
2. `/reload` is usually enough for Lua-only changes.
3. A full relaunch is safer when files, XML includes, assets, or bundled modules change.

## Guide Profiles

- Current default guide content is the remastered, TrinityCore-oriented profile for WotLK 3.3.5a private servers.
- An optional Alliance fallback profile exists at `Guides\Leveling_Original\ZygorGuidesAlliance.lua`.
- That fallback is original, unmodified classic Zygor content and should only be used if the remastered default route is problematic for a specific session.

## Localization

Localization key coverage is complete across shipped locales (`Main` + `NPCs`) with placeholder and format-consistency checks.

Current focus is community QA review:

- natural phrasing in live gameplay context,
- terminology consistency,
- official localized NPC proper names,
- encoding and readability verification.

Localization was largely AI-assisted and should be treated as needing community review until native-speaker QA confirms quality.

### Community Credits

- [`mikki33`](https://github.com/mikki33) for providing Russian localization changes and review updates.

## Support Wanted (Localization QA)

If you can validate translations in-game, your help is very welcome.

Please report:

- mistranslations,
- awkward phrasing,
- broken placeholders (`%s`, `%d`, `|n`, color codes),
- incorrect NPC names,
- encoding artifacts.

## Safety and Trust

This addon is fully open source and can be inspected before use.

## Changelog

### Revision 188 - 3.0.188

- Fixed Gear Advisor behavior on custom-server classes/specs so unknown builds no longer spam raw `Unknown spec` chat messages.
- Added user-editable `Custom Spec 1`, `Custom Spec 2`, and `Custom Spec 3` stat-weight profiles for custom-server fallback use.
- Unknown class/spec fallback now defaults to `Custom Spec 1` and prints one Zygor-branded Gear Advisor notice pointing users to Stat Weights.
- Fixed embedded Stat Weights `Show All Stats` refresh so the scrollbar appears immediately, and right-aligned the scrollbar inside the options frame.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.188.

### Revision 187 - 3.0.187

- Fixed Gear Finder paired-slot duplicate handling so the same trinket or ring is not recommended in both slots when item IDs are represented differently internally.
- Improved tier-progression filtering so early results are pruned before display while still allowing the next regular T7/Naxx progression step when a current pre-raid or heroic slot has no upgrade.
- Fixed AtlasLoot compatibility with `GetItemQualityColor()` so external addon item names no longer show raw quality hex prefixes such as `ffa334eeItem Name`.
- Added a Gear Finder startup item-cache guard. Opening Gear Finder immediately after login now shows a loading state and auto-scans after item data has had time to load.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.187.

### Revision 186 - 3.0.186

- Improved Gear Finder recommendations with ranked BiS-Tooltip data for mapped WotLK specs, including stronger Shadow priest pre-raid/T9/T10/RS ordering.
- Preserved Retail WotLK gear source tables when legacy faction gear files load, preventing missing source-backed upgrades.
- Improved Gear Finder handling for DB-backed items while the client is still retrieving live item info.
- Tightened tier-progression behavior with boss-row phase handling for late Vault of Archavon/Toravon-style rows and stricter progression-band pruning.
- Added `/zgvgeartrace <itemid>` diagnostics for Gear Finder oddities. Users should run it on any suspicious recommendation and send the copied popup text with a screenshot of the finder result.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.186.

### Revision 183 - 3.0.183

- Added Gear Advisor tooltip display options for `Upgrade Comparison`, `Item Score`, and `Both`.
- Added an optional normalized item score display mode for Pawn-like static score values.
- Localized the new tooltip value display and normalization options across supported addon locales.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.183.

### Revision 182 - 3.0.182

- Added a targeted Gear Advisor guard for WotLK tooltips that mark an equipment subtype red on the right side of the item type row.
- Items flagged this way are rejected before scoring with diagnostic code `tooltip_subtype`.
- Updated `/zgvgearbug` output to include `tipUnusable=true/false` in the cached item line.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.182.

### Revision 181 - 3.0.181

- Added the diagnostic-only `/zgvgearbug` slash command for Gear Advisor/Gear Finder item reports.
- The command prints DB, live item info, cached item state, advisor validity, score, API probes, equipped slot baselines, and tooltip scanner color lines for a supplied item ID/link.
- No recommendation behavior was changed in this release.
- Updated addon version metadata to 3.0.181.

## Notes

- Intended target client is **WotLK 3.3.5a (12340)**.
- It may work on other versions, but compatibility is not guaranteed.
- `ZygorTalentAdvisor` is bundled and loaded from within `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`.

## Known Issues

- Arrow scale/position drift:
  - On some setups, changing Waypoint Arrow Scale can shift the arrow position unexpectedly.
  - Resetting arrow position may not fully normalize the anchor in all UI/minimap addon combinations.
  - Status: deferred for now.

- Some imported guides may be incomplete or not fully aligned to 3.3.5a data.
- If a guide behaves incorrectly, disable it in `ZygorGuidesViewerRM/Guides/Autoload.xml` and report it.
